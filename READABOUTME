Hello,ðŸ‘‹

I am a self-taught Data Scientist, Career Changer ( Head of Science) and Chemistry Masters graduate, with a strong foundation in Data Analysis, Software programming concepts & Cloud Infastructure.

My motivation for choosing a career in Tech, and changing from teaching Science, comes from a university project. I had to create a website to display my dissertation project, and I learned the syntax of HTML, CSS, JavaScript to complete this. 

During this time, I realised how I can transform ideas to a working application, leading to a real positive benefit on the community around me. This drives me to produce the best work I can using the best practices.

During the past year I have upskilled my knowledge foundation by attending a skills Bootcamp in Data Analysis.

I am excited to apply my skills in a professional setting to further develop and consolidate my knowledge.

Take a peak at some of my work below!
